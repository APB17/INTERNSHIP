# ðŸ“§ Detecting Spam Emails Using TensorFlow in Python

This project demonstrates how to use **Deep Learning** with **TensorFlow** to classify email messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It leverages text preprocessing, LSTM networks, and model evaluation techniques to build an efficient spam detection system.
